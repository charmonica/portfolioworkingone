                <h2>Hey! I'm Chrissy.</h2>
                <p>An unrepentant nerd based in Newark, DE but who considers the Greater Philadelphia region to be home. I'm an enthusiastic student and creator of code, voraciously consuming everything I can learn after accidentally obtaining a humanities degree.</p>

                <h2>Want to know more?</h2>
                <p>At my core, I'm just a weird kid who has always enjoyed working collaboratively as part of a team. I spent my undergraduate career at Widener University as a member of a wide variety of causes and organizations, and spent time serving as president and vice president of organizations like the LGBTQ+ Alliance and the Humanities Association. I still enjoy de-stressing the way I did then, by mucking around with the code that powers my favorite games - both web-based and otherwise. It's a little embarrassing how long it took me to realize that might have been a sign that History was the wrong degree for me.</p>
            
                <p>I'm spending much of my time now formally learning the ins and outs of web development. I'm eager to work with current professionals or other learners to improve my skill and knowledge in working with various coding languages, including:</p>

                <h2>Services</h2>
                <p>I aim to provide bespoke web design services in a timely, detailed manner. My focus currently lies in front-end web development and the creation of streamlined websites conforming to each individual client's needs and aesthetic vision. It is my goal as a web developer to present clients with easily navigable and intuitive digital content that suits their needs, translating their vision into reality in each step of production, as well as providing services such as:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Frontend Design <p>Clean, intuitive interface creation that displays accurately on a variety of platforms and devices.</p> </li>
                  <li>Website Repair <p>Old code got you busted? I'll roll up my sleeves and get to bug-testing and fixing.</p></li>

                <p>Things are a little bare around here right now but eventually this will be where I showcase the work I've done on various projects using programming languages like JavaScript or Python. It's my intention to document my work in all stages of product creation, including:</p>

                    <li>Concept design</li>
